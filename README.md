# stock analysis
module 2
## Overview of the project
We had to refactor the code of a given project where we performed a stock analysis based on multiple years. By doing that, we will see if the code is running faster or not. 
## Results
As you can see in the resources folder, the code ran under a second for both years. We would have liked to present the old version but when we tried to run it, there were bugs. We can say that a refactored code help you to find bugs more easily. We also think that the refactored code is easier to understand. 
## Summary
We briefly talked about it in the previous section, but a refactored code makes software easier to understand, helps finding bugs and helps programming faster. The original script was harder to understand, there were so many more steps. We also did not see why there were bugs (maybe a copy/paste error).
